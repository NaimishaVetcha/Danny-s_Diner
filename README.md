Case Study 1 from Danny's 8_week_SQL_Challenge

Source: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/

Problem Statement:
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL. Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

1) sales
2) menu
3) members


Note: This project is performed in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18.
